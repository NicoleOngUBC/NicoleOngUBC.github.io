<h2>Going Solo:<br/>The Canadian Rockies in 2020</h2>

<h3>Trip Conception</h3>

<p>About 7 months into a global pandemic and 10 months into a nursing degree at UBC, my mechanic gave me distressing news about Joe, my beloved 20-year-old Honda CR-V—my “adventure steed”. One of Joe’s engine cylinders was starting to fail and apparently most people would scrap the car at this point…. the auto version of euthanasia. I could not bear the thought of Joe being salvaged for parts at a junkyard if all it took was an engine rebuild (much time and money) to save him—and so I did.</p>

<p>On the morning of August 15, I collected a resuscitated Joe, and somehow by dinnertime I had hatched a travelling plan (with much encouragement from my friend, Dave). The plan was to take a solo road trip to the Rockies. Within less than a week, a tentative driving route/loop was created, and last minute camping reservations were (miraculously available) and made. I was to camp around <em>Banff</em>, <em>Jasper</em>, and <em>Mt Robson</em>, specifically in <em>Two Jacks Main</em>, <em>Lucerne</em>, <em>Kinney Lake</em>, and <em>Robson River</em> campgrounds. </p>

<figure><img src="Image.jpeg" alt="A tentative driving plan was born" width="600"/><figcaption>A tentative driving plan was born</figcaption></figure>

<p>Once those reservations were confirmed, I could first work out other trip logistics before deciding how long the trip would actually be—whether to camp in Revelstoke/Golden before reaching Banff, or spend time in Prince George after leaving Mt. Robson.</p>

<h3>Hitting the Road</h3>

<h4>21 August 2020<em></em></h4>

<p>On August 21, I was finally ready to embark on my journey, a ‘whopping’ 6 days after it was conceived. <em>Multiple</em> trips to the parkade were made to load Joe up with a ridiculous amount of food, gear, cushions, and other miscellaneous items. </p>

<figure><img src="IMG_9616.JPG" alt="I think I brought enough food for a month" width="600"/><figcaption>I think I brought enough food for a month</figcaption></figure>

<p>As I pulled into the Trans-Canada Highway, I said a silent prayer for Joe to make it through this trip—particularly along stretches of highway known to be without cellular reception. To help maintain my alertness, as it was 8.30 am and I hadn’t sleep much the night before, I blasted songs from my smart phone, and was amazed at how confidently I belted out lyrics from Alanis Morissette’s “Jagged little pill” album. Near the Abbotsford section of the highway, I was astounded for a moment at the sight before me. It was late summer, but before me was a fully snow-covered mountain against a backdrop of darker peaks. What was going on? It took me several seconds to realize that this wasn’t a mountain—it was a massive, bell-shaped cloud that looked exactly like the normal, statistical curve. At that moment I longed for a dash cam which would have captured the image, and made a mental note to have my Canon point-and-shoot camera on standby.</p>

<figure><img src="IMG_9618.JPG" alt="Gas and washroom break in Salmon Arm, BC" width="600"/><figcaption>Gas and washroom break in Salmon Arm, BC</figcaption></figure>

<p>It took almost 10 hours, including rest stops, to reach <em>Whispering Spruce</em> campground in Golden, which goes by Mountain Time. It was almost 7pm when I checked in, roughly an hour to two before sunset. As it looked like rain would soon come, I tried to put up a tarp by tying to the trees and the roof rack of my car. This was a futile effort. I had squandered 45 min trying to put the tarp up and another 10 min taking it down. By the time I started “making dinner”, which involved rehydrating a cup of Miso soup, and heating a can of Campbell’s steak and potatoes, it was already dusk, and a swarm of vicious mosquitoes were attacking me. While I had a potent variety of insect repellent that contained deet, it was warm and I was about to lay in my sleeping bag, so I opted not to use them. Meanwhile, I established that citronella candles do not deter these pests (see photo of drowned mozzie in citronella candle).</p>

<figure><img src="Citronella%20candle.jpg" alt="Perhaps I&#39;ll get a refund from OFF!" width="400"/><figcaption>Perhaps I&#39;ll get a refund from OFF!</figcaption></figure>

<p>My tent neighbours offered mosquito coil, claiming that they work well. Feeling embarrassed that I must seem to them a noob to camping, I politely declined, seeing that rain would soon come and I could just hide out in my car. Rain came with distant thunder and lightning. As I sat eating my dinner in Joe, fazed by bugs and wet weather, I felt ready to pack up and go home, rueing the day I planned the trip. Yet, these conditions weren’t surprising to me; after all I did show up with a tarp for inclement weather, as well as a bevy of bug sprays. Prior to the trip, I even had the presence of mind to duct tape a bug screen to one of my back passenger windows, to roll it down in case I had to sleep or hang out in the car. </p>

<p>As the rain let up I darted into the tent for more comfortable refuge, only to find my fly was no longer waterproof and my stuff were damp. My Black Diamond Mesa tent was, after all, 8 years old, and had been shedding its seam tape for the past few seasons. For the next 2 hours, I turned my attention to more enjoyable tasks, such as reading up on hikes in Yoho National Park in my new guidebook, “Easy walks and hikes in the Canadian Rockies”, before turning in for the night, completely exhausted from the bustle of packing and long hours of driving. However, within an hour it started pouring rain again. Having seen other campers drape and secure their tarp directly on top of their tent fly, I hurried out of my tent to do the same. In the few minutes I took to tie down my tarp (which thankfully waterproofed my tent quite adequately), I accumulated 12 fresh mosquito bites on my arms and legs despite my best efforts to swat at the buggers. I made a mental note to purchase mosquito coils as soon as I can.</p>

<h3>Golden and Yoho National Park</h3>

<h4>22 August 2020</h4>

<p>Sleeping in till 9am, the bug situation was much better than at dusk or dawn (or midnight for that matter). I made coffee, ate my bagel, and cooked some hardboiled eggs, before chatting with my neighbours, Mairead (the Irish version of “Margaret”) and her son, Patrick. They recommended that I hike <em>Wapta Falls</em> and <em>Emerald Lake</em>, two of the Yoho attractions closest to our location.</p>

<p>Before setting off on my hike, I decided that something had to be done about my system of organization—for I had none. Any time I needed anything I scoured the entire car to find the item, and cussed a fair bit when I failed to locate it. </p>

<p>Mentally, I split the car into zones for storage of various categories of gear. The trunk became storage for anything food- or cook gear-related. Back seats became the home location for my cushions, clothes, shoes, tools, books, outdoor gear, and auto miscellaneous items. Front passenger seat/floor was to store my day/overnight packs, snacks, water, firewood, electronic cables, etc. Having a system reduced my time searching for stuff over the next 2 days, though I still struggled, every now and then, trying to recall the category I had assigned my gear. For instance, were the scissors stored with tools in the back seat or with my cook gear in the trunk?</p>

<h5>Wapta Falls</h5>

<p>By the time I was at my first hike, an easy 2.4km walk with minimal elevation change, it was past noon. I walked fast and overtook a large number of families that were leisurely strolling to Wapta Falls—the “Niagara“ of Yoho.</p>

<figure><img src="IMG_9622.JPG" alt="Pleasant flat trail to Wapta Falls" width="400"/><figcaption>Pleasant flat trail to Wapta Falls</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="Wapta%20falls.jpg" alt="GPS track - Wapta Falls" width="400"/><figcaption>GPS track - Wapta Falls</figcaption></figure>

<p>Later on, I apparently walked by Mairead and Patrick at the beach area of Wapta Falls, but being very focused on getting to my next destination, I didn’t see them. Driving out onto the merging lane of the highway, I was stopped by a magnificent sight of the mountain range just ahead. This is indeed a special part of the world with views one will never tire of.</p>

<figure><img src="IMG_9636.JPG" alt="Endless spectacular views like this in Yoho National Park" width="600"/><figcaption>Endless spectacular views like this in Yoho National Park</figcaption></figure>

<h5>Emerald Lake / Yoho Pass</h5>

<p>My next destination was Emerald Lake, a popular and busy spot with the tourists. Once I got away from the immediate perimeter of the lake, the trail was much quieter. Due to my late start, I knew I wouldn’t make it to Yoho Pass, a 12.8 km return trip from the parking lot, so I set a turnaround time and tried to get as high up to the pass as I could.</p>

<figure><img src="Emerald%20lake.jpg" alt="GPS track - Yoho Pass" width="400"/><figcaption>GPS track - Yoho Pass</figcaption></figure>

<p>Having had no luck finding mosquito coils (they seemed to be sold out everywhere I looked in Golden &amp; Banff), I got dinner at Tim Horton’s drive through and arrived back at Whispering Spruce around 7pm. I accepted Mairead’s kind offer of mosquito coils, and hung out with my new neighbours (Katie and Shaun) by their campfire. Katie was a registered nurse in Edmonton and so it led to discussions on health care in Alberta. BC definitely sounded like the safer haven for healthcare professionals.</p>

<h4>23 August</h4>

<p>Since I was moving to my next campsite in Banff, I packed quickly and bid farewell to Mairead and Patrick. This wound up being a 30-min conversation, with telephone numbers exchanged so that I could look up Mairead when I got to Prince George. Interestingly they had a private conversation guessing my profession—Mairead thought I was a teacher, and Patrick thought I was a nurse—they were pleased to know they were both kinda right though I wasn’t yet a nurse and was no longer a teacher.</p>

<h5>Takakkaw Falls</h5>

<p>On my way to Banff, I checked out Takakkaw Falls in Yoho National Park, a highly accessible sightseeing spot, only 5 min walk from the parking lot.</p>

<figure><img src="IMG_9689.JPG" alt="Takakkaw from the parking area" width="300"/> <img src="IMG_9718.JPG" width="300"/></figure>

<figure><img src="IMG_9754.JPG" alt="Takakkaw Falls in the PM" width="600"/><figcaption>Takakkaw Falls in the PM</figcaption></figure>

<h5>Iceline Trail</h5>

<p>After Takakkaw Falls, I hiked the Iceline trail on the opposite side of the valley. Most of this trail consisted of forested switchbacks until I was on an open ridge. From the ridge, I could look across the valley and see Takakkaw Falls and <em>Laughing Falls</em>, remnants of a glacier, and a scattering of orange/golden nuggets of rocks in various sizes.</p>

<p>On my return journey, I met a lone hiker, Doris, who was originally from Quebec. Doris had moved to Calgary more than a decade ago, and lived an active life filled with yoga, standup paddling, hiking, and skiing. Later on, Doris sent me SMS messages with weather forecasts for the rest of my trip as her way of looking out for a new friend and solo traveller. </p>

<figure><img src="IMG_9750.JPG" alt="Pictured here amongst the rocks is Doris" width="600"/><figcaption>Pictured here amongst the rocks is Doris</figcaption></figure>

<p>As I continued my drive towards Banff, through the mountain passes of Yoho National Park, I marvelled at the scenery around me, and made a mental note to return for the hikes I had to pass in Yoho.</p>

<h5>Two Jack Main</h5>

<p>That evening, I arrived at Two Jack Main campground in Banff with sufficient daylight to switch my campground reservation to one that allowed a campfire, collect <em>free</em> firewood(?!), start a fire, pitch my tent, and cook a proper meal (Japanese curry, which I struggled to finish).</p>

<figure><img src="IMG_9787.JPG" alt="Other campers cooked with their instant pot in the washroom!" width="400"/><figcaption>Other campers cooked with their instant pot in the washroom!</figcaption></figure>

<p>My campsite was large, and neighbouring sites were less than 10 metres away. On my left was a family of 3 adults and 3 kids with an RV; on the right was a group of young adults that made a huge campfire, chatted loudly and smoked pot well past the typical quiet time for campgrounds. I was glad to have my ear plugs handy.</p>

<h3>Banff National Park</h3>

<h4>24 August</h4>

<p>Waking up to morning sunshine, I made another ‘<em>fancy</em>’ meal, which sparked conversations with my neighbours. At one point, they asked about noise and apologized, though I assured them I slept very well with ear plugs, which I always brought on camping trips. After breakfast, I lounged for a bit in my lovely, new surroundings before heading out to Downtown Banff for information. </p>

<h5>Downtown Banff</h5>

<p>It was not easy to park in Downtown Banff. I waited until a parking spot opened, spoke to a host at an outdoor booth (instead of the usual visitor centre due to COVID-19 restrictions), and got a sense of the hikes I ought to do, and which ones were closed for the season. </p>

<figure><img src="IMG_9805.JPG" alt="Downtown Banff" width="400"/><figcaption>Downtown Banff</figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="IMG_9806.JPG" width="600"/></figure>

<p>Here I learned that it was almost impossible to see Lake Moraine because of the horrific parking situation—only 30-so parking spots in one of the most Instagrammed locations in Canada—unless one arrived at the parking lot by 5am. There wasn’t a line up for cars to get into. The flaggers simply allowed the next 10 random cars onto the road leading to Lake Moraine, once they counted that 10 cars have exited the lake. I shelved my plan to hike around Lake Moraine for a future trip.</p>

<h5>Tunnel Mountain</h5>

<p>From Downtown Banff, it was a short drive to Tunnel Mountain—a short, easy hike with sufficient elevation gain promising amazing, panoramic views all around. It being a hot day in Banff, I bought ice at a grocery store, and brought them with me in an insulated lunch bag. Kicking back and having a cup of ice cold coke on the summit was an experience I wanted to toast to. However, with no one to share the moment with, I posted pictures and shared my feelings of the moment on social media as a means of staving off sudden pangs of loneliness. I’m a social being after all, as evidenced by the ease with which I seek out other travellers to chat with.</p>

<h5>Johnson Lake</h5>

<p>With little time to spare before dark, I checked out Johnson Lake, a popular swimming spot near the Two Jack campgrounds. The sky was a little overcast by this point, and drizzling, so I had most of the trail to myself.</p>

<h3>Kootenay National Park</h3>

<h4>25 August</h4>

<p>The next morning I had breakfast with much less faff knowing the long day before me involved a hike up the Stanley Glacier trail (recommended by my nursing classmate, Lauren).</p>

<h5>Marble Canyon</h5>

<p>En route to Stanley Glacier, I made a quick stop at Marble Canyon in Kootenay National Park. Here I walked for 20 minutes along a manicured path above a canyon.</p>

<h5>Stanley Glacier</h5>

<p>Next, I arrived at the Stanley Glacier trailhead around 10am with plenty of time for the 11 km return hike. This is an area of geological interest, as there were physical signs indicating there were regular tours taking place on this hike. The landscape and surroundings were spectacular, and it might have been possible to hike further up the valley (past the waterfalls), but most people turned around before the climb became much steeper. A bit of route finding was necessary here as there weren’t any markers/flagging, and plenty of loose rocks that could endanger hikers.</p>

<p>On my way out I met another lone female hiker, Tanis, with whom I had a stimulating conversation on the state of the Calgary/Albertan economy, and how offices in downtown Calgary were empty due to the pandemic. At the end of the hike, Tanis and I soaked our exhausted feet in a cool creek before sharing our photos and saying our goodbyes.</p>

<p>Driving back to Two Jack Main campground, I stopped in a scenic spot along the road, unfolded my lawn chair, and checked my emails before heading back to camp where there was no cellular access. I washed some of my clothes and dried them by the fire that evening, seeing that my next campground did not have such luxurious amenities, i.e., wash area, and running water.</p>

<h3>Icefield Parkway</h3>

<h4>26 August</h4>

<p>On the Icefield Parkway, there is an abundance of easy, scenic hikes, particularly around Banff and in the first half of the Icefield Parkway. At the end of this day (and for the next 2 nights), I was to camp at <em>Lucerne</em> campground in Mt Robson Provincial Park, about 37 km east of Jasper, which meant I only had time for a few select hikes around Banff National Park. Eventually I decided on Parker Ridge and Wilcox Pass (both near the Saskatchewan crossing separating Banff and Jasper National Parks). They turned out to be my favourite hikes on this trip.</p>

<h5>Parker Ridge</h5>

<p>Parker Ridge was an easy, 5.2 km round trip on a trail that quickly takes one onto the ridge, offering a spectacular view of the Saskatchewan Glacier. </p>

<p>I spotted my first, proper wildlife on this trip—a fox?</p>

<figure><img src="IMG_2017.JPG" alt="A fox?" width="600"/><figcaption>A fox?</figcaption></figure>

<p>An older gentleman thought I might be mistaken and took a quick peek at my blurry, zoomed in digital photo of the animal. He believed it to be a fox too but noted that it was odd to see foxes there. I didn’t get a chance to ask him why before he continued on his way. On Parker Ridge, I met 3 hikers from Vancouver who were driving and sleeping in their car parked along the highway (which must have been quite unpleasant), and offered to share my Lucerne campsite with them should their plans change. My site accommodated at least 4 campers, so I anticipated it being safe enough to share even with physical distancing restrictions.</p>

<h5>Wilcox Pass</h5>

<p>My next hike to Wilcox Pass was quite a bit longer than expected, as I needed to hike out to the Wilcox Ridge viewpoint for an even better view of the Columbia Icefield (more specifically, Athabasca Glacier) without having to pay for a tour on it. The hike started with a gradual climb through a forest, and soon followed the contour of the ridge, with amazing views of the mountains and glacier.</p>

<p>Continuing onto the Wilcox viewpoint, I saw Big Horned Sheep that were so well camouflaged against the rocky terrain that I almost missed them! At the viewpoint, with Athabasca Glacier across the highway, I believe I wore all my warm clothes—down jacket, Goretex jacket, and toque—to stay warm from the unrelenting glacier-chilled wind.</p>

<h5>Downtown Jasper / Lucerne Campground</h5>

<p>By the time I returned to Joe I was completely knackered but immensely pleased with the hikes I had done. I drove into Downtown Jasper, filled up on gas, and bought KFC fried chicken for dinner. I arrived at Lucerne campground with enough time to get settled before dark, and found the campsites more spacious and spread out between sites than at Two Jacks. No potable water or flush toilets though. A friendly camp host provided useful information about hikes around Jasper, the Berg Lake trail, and sold me some firewood. (Coincidentally, I would bump into the camp host and his girlfriend on my hike out of Berg Lake trail 4 days later.) I set up my tent that evening, built my campfire, and felt very pleased with the quality hikes I had completed in the Rockies.</p>

<h3>Jasper National Park</h3>

<h4>27 August</h4>

<p>My plan for the day was to have a ‘rest’ day and sleep in. After making a late breakfast, I walked around my campground and found some campsites that were right on the water. Though chillier at night, the views of the lake were amazing! This was also the cold water lake a little girl was swimming in and had coaxed me to “swim in” too. I submerged my full body for probably 2 seconds before I scrambled out of the water, shivering.</p>

<p>After a leisurely drive into Jasper, I found the downtown visitor centre to gather some maps and ideas for the next 2 days. I bought an ice cream, and walked the Jasper discovery trail in downtown Jasper for the rest of the afternoon, even finding time to text my friends in Vancouver, including chatting with Dave for a full hour on the phone. Except for a handful of trail runners, I didn’t meet other hikers on this trail.</p>

<p>I bought groceries, a hatchet, and mosquito coils (finally found them after looking in 3 cities) before returning to Lucerne. I checked out the campground’s water pump, and built myself a solid campfire with my new hatchet. </p>

<p>It was a pleasant, starry night to sit by the fire reflecting on life in the past year as a student nurse, how I was barely surviving online schooling during a pandemic, and my future career aspirations as a registered nurse. I planned on backtracking to the 2nd half of the Icefield Parkway the next day, so it was essential that I got a good night’s rest and early start.</p>

<h4>28 August</h4>

<p>Next morning, however, my plans were thwarted by a funding screw-up for the next school term. At a parking lot in downtown Jasper, I was put on hold with both StudentAid BC and UBC Bursary for more than 2 hours. In the end, nothing was resolved, and the calls had used up most of my cellular talk time.</p>

<h5>Beauty Creek</h5>

<p>By the time I got to Beauty Creek trailhead on the Icefield Parkway, it was almost noon. Beauty creek was a short, easy trail with little elevation gain. Next to the creek, the bank was filled with beautiful white, field flowers, and little waterfalls were strewn along sections of the creek. </p>

<p>I briefly chatted with a pair of Indigenous women along the way, and an older couple that hiked with beautiful, home-made walking sticks. Until I returned to my car, I had no idea I had been walking around with hideous streaks of sunscreen all over my face…. I’m not sure how the people I met kept a straight face and failed to mention this to me. :D </p>

<h5>Sunwapta Falls</h5>

<p>Next, I made a quick 10-min stop at Sunwapta falls, where there were loads of tourists.</p>

<h5>Valley of the Five Lakes</h5>

<p>For my last hike on the Icefield Parkway, I hiked a loop around the Valley of the 5 lakes. The trail was not particularly scenic (relative to standards around the Rockies), but because little elevation gain, and possibly warm-ish lakes, this was a popular swimming/Instagramming spot. So many young people were taking photos of themselves jumping into the lakes—I left as quickly as my legs would take me.</p>

<p>Back at Lucerne campground, I packed up my tent and had a quick dinner seeing that rain was coming, and I would be hiking with my overnight pack the next day. Sleeping diagonally in the back of my car (with the backseats folded down) was pretty comfortable with the right amount of padding in the right places. Surprisingly, everything I brought and bought fit in the car with me.</p>

<h3>Mt. Robson Provincial Park</h3>

<h4>29 August</h4>

<p>The next morning I woke up early and snapped a few photos of how I slept in the car before leaving for Mt. Robson.</p>

<p>At the visitor centre, due to the no-shows I was able to switch my campground from Kinney Lake (the 1st of 6 backcountry campsites on the Berg Lake trail, 6km in) to White Horn (the 2nd campsite, 11km in) for the night. Unfortunately I was not prepared to camp for more than 1 night, as there were campsites available for the following night. In regular seasons, the lack of penalty for no-shows isn’t an issue, as Berg Lake campsites are massively popular (snapped up within minutes of reservations opening) and no-shows were few. This year though, a large number of campers failed to show up and did not bother to cancel their reservations—this meant that keen campers like myself could only secure one of the sites on the day of, at the registration desk for the Berg Lake hike. :(</p>

<h5>Berg Lake Trail</h5>

<p>The hike into Kinney Lake was long, following a well-trodden logging road next to the creek through the forest, but it was relatively easy. The lake itself was pretty with reflections of the surrounding mountains making it a picturesque image fit for a postcard.</p>

<figure><img src="IMG_2056.JPG" width="600"/></figure>

<p>Past Kinney Lake, there was a series of switchbacks that led to quick elevation gain. Approximately 6-7 hours into my hike I arrived at White Horn campground.</p>

<p>Perhaps it had been too long since I had hiked with an overnight pack, but having no one to share the usual weight of a tent and cook gear made my pack pretty heavy though I tried to pack as light as I could—leaving behind some of my usual comfort items like hut booties and an extra jacket. After a food food break at White Horn, I realized I was done for the day at 4pm, and I was starting to get quite cold. I pitched my tent and got into my sleeping bag to rest and warm up. I also managed to borrow a book from the ranger, having seen him earlier during my food break. When I made dinner an hour later, I met my new tent neighbours, Donna and Juanita, who shared important trail information with me, and encouraged me to go as high up the trail as I could—at the very least, to Emperor Falls. Their incredible fitness and sprightly attitude would motivate me to hike all the way to Berg lake the next day, another 10 km up the trail from White Horn.</p>

<h4>30 August</h4>

<h5>Emperor Falls</h5>

<p>Donna and Juanita were up early in the morning. They made sure I was awake at a reasonable time (6.30am?) to have enough time to hike up and out successfully. Juanita gave me a sachet of Starbucks instant coffee at breakfast and she would not have found a more grateful recipient for this gift! I felt vastly better after getting some caffeine in my system. Leaving my overnight gear at White Horn, I continued my hike towards towards Emperor’s Falls at 8am. </p>

<h5>Berg Lake</h5>

<p>Back at Emperor Falls I decided to hike all the way to Berg Lake, where the 6th campground would be. On arriving at Berg Lake, I spent almost an hour snacking and taking in the white, blue and turquoise of my surroundings. Of course the backcountry campsites were snapped up like hotcakes each year. I could see myself making this hike a yearly pilgrimage except it was nearly impossible to reserve the campsites; and I wasn’t fit enough to cover 42 km in a day…. (Yet? Future goals???)</p>

<p>After completing the Berg Lake hike, I drove to the visitor centre and checked my messages and e-mail outside the entrance as this was the only place with wifi around Mt. Robson (there was no cellular reception at all). While I was making plans to hike with Donna and Juanita the next day, I met Melissa. Melissa was supposed to hike up to Kinney Lake that day and spend 2 nights at her backcountry campsite. However the centre was already closed—it was well past 6pm by this time, and the registration representatives were gone.</p>

<h5>Robson River Campground</h5>

<p>After weighing her options, Melissa opted to share my campsite at Robson River campground for the night, instead of hiking in the dark on a trail that recently had reports of bear sightings. In retrospect, it was a good decision. As we were preparing to start a campfire and cook our dinners, Melissa realized her headlamp wasn’t working. We chatted for a bit after dinner, but I was quickly tiring from my 30 km hike that day. Having slept so well in my car during my last night at Lucerne, and seeing how spread out campsites were in Robson River, I decided to sleep in the security (or perceptions of security) a solid vehicle provided in comparison to a fabric tent; so did Melissa. </p>

<h4>31 August</h4>

<p>Melissa was up early next morning and had driven off to begin her Berg Lake hike before I was up.</p>

<h5>Little Lost Lake</h5>

<p>After breakfast I met Donna and Juanita at the trailhead of the Little Lost Lake trail. These two ladies had a ton of energy, especially Juanita. I struggled to keep up with them! :D</p>

<h5>Rearguard Falls / Swift Creek Salmon Viewing</h5>

<p>Donna and Juanita next took me to Rearguard Falls (where only the largest, strongest salmon are able to swim this far up the Fraser River), and Swift Creek salmon viewing spot (in Valemount) to catch the salmon run. I recorded videos of a number of large salmon leaping up over rapids/mini waterfalls in the river. It was incredible!</p>

<p>Eventually it was time to bid farewells to my new friends. Alone again, I drove into downtown <strong>Valemount</strong> to check out the <em>Gathering Tree Eatery</em> on 5th Avenue, which Donna recommended. There I ate a tasty lunch, researched my next locations to visit, and recharged my electronics. Chilling in my car that night, I watched “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”, a movie I had pre-loaded onto my iPad. I had forgotten how much I enjoy this movie.</p>

<h3>Jasper National Park</h3>

<h4>1 September</h4>

<h5>Maligne Canyon</h5>

<p>For my final day in the Rockies, I backtracked to Jasper National Park to explore Maligne Canyon and the Maligne Lake area. Maligne Canyon was quite spectacular, but it was also busy, and looking down into Canyons isn’t quite as intriguing as being in one, I suppose. I soon got bored and finished the hike as soon as I could, skirting around human traffic the whole way. </p>

<figure><img src="IMG_2286.JPG" width="600"/></figure>

<figure><img src="IMG_2293.jpg" width="600"/></figure>

<p>Next, I drove to the Maligne Lake area. The drive itself was so beautiful that I stopped at a couple of pullouts for photographs even though I was running short on time. This area also showed signs of wildfire activity.</p>

<p>It was almost 4pm by the time I arrived at Maligne lake. I decided to do an easy hike that involved almost no elevation gain—the Mary Schaeffer loop.</p>

<p>Since it was my last day in the Rockies, I felt compelled to spend my tourist dollars here. I bought some t-shirts at the gift shop, and dined out for the first time since the pandemic started. By that time of day, I was the sole diner at the restaurant by the lake. The server and manager both chatted with me, and provided excellent service and valuable information (e.g., lunch time was the best time for sighting moose around the lake). I ate a delectable 3-course meal that cost only 40 dollars, but I added a 50 % tip as they kept the place open just to serve me. Someday, a 20-dollar tip will hopefully feel like chump change!</p>

<p>Instead of walking straight to the car after dinner, I wanted to get a small walk in by the lake. To my surprise, a moose was hanging out in it and it was my first moose sighting ever. What a treat to top off this incredible day at Maligne Lake! </p>

<p>On the drive out of Maligne Lake, the scenery was so incredible that I randomly shot photos on my camera while driving with no other cars on the road. I felt quite confident manoeuvring the steering wheel with one hand and handling my point-and-shoot camera with the other, but yeah.... this was probably not safe in any other driving condition.</p>

<p>Upon returning to Robson River campground, I saw Melissa again after her hike to Berg Lake. We swapped stories over the campfire, and before long we ducked into our cars for the night as heavy rain came down on us.</p>

<h3>Prince George</h3>

<h4>2 September</h4>

<p>Melissa left for the Okanagan early next morning. I had breakfast by my campfire, where I dried out my leftover logs that were damp despite my best efforts to keep them dry under the bench. Feeling a tinge of sadness that my trip was almost coming to an end, I slowly packed up my campsite and moseyed my way towards Prince George.</p>

<figure><img src="IMG_0566.JPG" alt="This was the largest campsite I stayed in in the Rockies, with oodles of space between sites" width="600"/><figcaption>This was the largest campsite I stayed in in the Rockies, with oodles of space between sites</figcaption></figure>

<h5>Ancient Forest Trail</h5>

<p>Along the way, I stopped at the Ancient Forest trail on Highway 16. A traveller I met along the way thought the trees in Ancient Forest were dying. I had no idea if this was truth to this opinion, so I walked the forest with a sense of appreciation that I tended to save for the short-lived or exceptional phenomena.</p>

<p>I pulled into Blue Cedars campground in Prince George (PG) at around 5pm that day, and perfectly understood why the Canadian Rockies was a world-renowned attraction. Beauty was to be found everywhere in the Rockies, including its campgrounds. In contrast, Blue Cedars was functional, but not particularly well-maintained or attractive. My campsite was in fact, uninviting and muddy. After taking a moment to read up on PG’s attractions, I met Mairead at Cottonwood Island Nature Park for an easy stroll before we had dinner at the Northern Lights Estate Winery. It was indeed much easier to make friends while travelling solo—I was touched by Mairead’s hospitality and kindness. She texted me to make sure I got back safely to my campground that night. Soon, it started pouring rain and I was glad I had again decided to sleep in the car.</p>

<h4>3 September</h4>

<p>Waking up to dreary, rainy weather, and muddy conditions around the campground, I thought it might be time to end the trip early. I called my friend, Kafui, to ask if there was a mall I could hang out in while it was raining. Kafui suggested that I stayed with him given the wet weather, and he wasn’t too worried that I was COVID-stricken as I had been travelling alone (I’ve been in an alternative version of quarantine, really). After getting to Kafui’s house, I bought groceries, made lunch, cleaned up a little, unpacked my tent to dry, walked around the neighbourhood, and then made dinner. It was odd doing the usual household chores indoors with electricity and running water at will; not having to set up a stove, tent, or start a fire. Taking a hot shower, and not having to sleep in a cramped space also felt like a strange luxury after camping outdoors for almost 2 weeks.</p>

<h4>4 September</h4>

<p>The next morning, I started working on stranger tasks I hadn’t done in a long time—I edited and proofed Kafui’s tenure promotion package (luckily his tenure application turned out to be successful or I might have blamed myself for the suggestions I made). In the afternoon, we walked around Shane Lake in Forests for the World, and checked out parts of UNBC. For dinner, we had Canadian Chinese take-out. They were not quite Vancouver standards, but I just needed some Asian food by then. We selected an old Hollywood film from Kafui’s impressive database of movies and TV shows to watch for the evening.</p>

<h3>Heading Home</h3>

<h4>5 September</h4>

<p>A new term of online schooling was about to begin again, and it was time to head home. It was yet another rainy day in Prince George as I loaded my car. Thankfully, most of the daytime bad weather I’d encountered had taken place while I was in PG, and not on my hikes in the Rockies. Outside of PG, the weather was lovely and sunny as I drove along the Cariboo highway, and Highway 1, all the way back to Burnaby, BC.</p>

<figure><img src="Return%20leg%20in%20red.png" alt="Return leg to the Lower Mainland on Highway 97, the Cariboo Highway, and Highway 1, instead of the initial plan to drive through Whistler (see route in red)" width="600"/><figcaption>Return leg to the Lower Mainland on Highway 97, the Cariboo Highway, and Highway 1, instead of the initial plan to drive through Whistler (see route in red)</figcaption></figure>

<p>As I unpacked the next day, I missed my carefree days of planning hikes, hiking through magnificent landscape, and living out of my car. Is this what tiny house living on wheels would feel like? I am intrigued by the movement and enjoy watching how others enact their plans for tiny house living. Scrolling through my photos, I knew I would have to return to the Rockies soon to complete the other amazing hikes I didn’t cover, and revisit my favourite places. Why not make this a yearly or biennial affair? While putting away the rest of my gear, I chuckled at the crazy amount of food I brought with me, most of which I had barely touched. I could have spent 2 more weeks on the road and probably not require more groceries. :D</p>
